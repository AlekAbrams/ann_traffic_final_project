Predicting Traffic and Vehicle/Biking Dynamics in Copenhagen

Research Question: To what extent can our trained models help predict traffic and reveal the relationship between vehicle and bicycle traffic across Copenhagen?

-Copenhagen is renowned for its unique blend of vehicular transport and cycling. 

-Understanding how these two systems interact is key to maintaining safe and sustainable traffic management.

-Using the Trafiktælling dataset, we plan to model and visualize predictive patterns in Copenhagen’s transportation network on its roads.

Main objective: Predict future months’ average vehicle traffic using historical trends, road characteristics, and cycling data. Explore temporal relationships between bicycle and vehicle flow with RNNs, analyze spatial correlations between roads using heatmaps.

Stretch goal: Use CNNs on monthly heatmaps to learn spatial patterns and produce predicted congestion maps.
