Predicting Traffic and Vehicle Dynamics in New York City

Research Question: To what extent can our trained models help predict traffic across New York City?

-New York City is renowned for chaotic and busy streets with a lot of traffic. 

-Understanding how traffic operates in the city is key to maintaining safe and sustainable traffic management.

-Using the NYC Open Data traffic volume counts dataset, we plan to model and visualize predictive patterns in New York City’s transportation network on its roads.

Main objective: Predict future months’ average vehicle traffic using historical trends and road/intersection characteristics. Explore temporal relationships with RNNs, analyze spatial correlations between roads using heatmaps.

Stretch goal: Use CNNs on monthly heatmaps to learn spatial patterns and produce predicted congestion maps.
